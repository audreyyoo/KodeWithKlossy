    <h2>The Positive Aspects</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "italics"> Here are some ways in which technology has improved the art world...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class = "topic">OUTREACH</p>
    <br>
    <p1>Art organizations are able to bring more attention to their events due to the outreach that technology gives
      art. This makes it easier for them to fundraise and engage with their audience.</p1>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class = "topic">DIVERSITY</p>
    <br>
    <p1>The art community has become more diverse due to easy access on the Internet and other technological mediums. This
      allows art to evolve, as people from different backgrounds are able to be included in consumption and creation.</p1>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class = "topic">ACCESSIBILITY</p>
    <br>
    <p1>Digital art is much cheaper than physical art, due to only requiring a digital device for creation, rather than
      buying multiple art supplies. Physical art supplies deteriorate overtime, especially at faster rates than digital devices.</p1>
