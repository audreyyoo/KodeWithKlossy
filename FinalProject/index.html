    <p class="topic">SOCIAL MEDIA</p>
    <br>
    <p1>Social media can perpetuate certain ideas about how content should be displayed or made. On social media,
      algorithms play a big part in how artists present their work. From having a frequent posting schedule to following
      popular trends, an artist has to work around algorithms to ensure that their work is seen. Algorithms can
      prevent artists from reaching a larger audience due to their content not being labelled as "popular" or
      "relevant."</p1>

    <p class="topic">COMMERCE</p>
    <br>
    <p1>Some people believe that due to the fact that it is online, digital art should be accessible to all. Many
      artists showcase their artworks freely online, while others have more exclusive works, where consumers have to
      pay to see them. The need to pay to see an artist's work, while being able to see another's freely, causes
      controversy. Many consumers believe that an artist should make their content free to the public because
      another one does.
      <br>
      <br>
      The quality of virtual art can differ from that of physical art, leading to misconceptions of how one or the other
      should look. Digital art generally looks cleaner and more vibrant than photos of art on physical mediums, since physical art is more easily affected lighting. These factors create misconceptions that digital art is of higher quality than physical art.

    <p class="topic">ART THEFT</p>
    <br>
    <p1>There are many instances where online art is stolen. Individuals and organizations alike
      steal artworks, edited or not, and claim them as their own. Many small artists are incapable of regaining rightful
      ownership of their art when a large organization steals it with little to no repercussions. Companies, such as
      Shein, are
      notorious for stealing from artists online.
      <br>
      <br>
      Along with the
      rise in popularity of NFTs (non-fungible tokens), there has been a rise in the number of art thefts. Many profit
      off of digital art and, due to how accessible art on the Internet is, many will try to profit off of others' work.

    <p class="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
    <br>
    <p1>As technology becomes more advanced, there has been a myriad of new ways to create art. Recently AI's are being
      used as a way to create art or even more abstract art, cutting out the need for human artists. As a result, artists struggle to get jobs, as their potential customers now have AIs that will get the job done at a much faster pace.</p1>
